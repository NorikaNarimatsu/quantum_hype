Nature of problem: Solutions of boundary value problems (BVPs) for the elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) of the Schrodinger type find wide application in molecular, atomic and nuclear physics, for example, in three-dimensional tunneling of a diatomic molecule incident upon a potential barrier, fission model of collision of heavy ions, fragmentation of light nuclei, a hydrogen atom in magnetic field, photoionization of Helium like atoms, one photon ionization of atoms, electron-impact ionization of molecular hydrogen and photodissociation of molecules in strong laser field [3,4]. In the coupled-channel adiabatic approach (CCAA) [4], known in mathematical physics as the Kantorovich method, the desirable solution of the original boundary value problem (BVP) is expanded over surface eigenfunctions in fast variables (for example, angular variables) of an auxiliary BVP for an appropriate PDE dependent on a slow variable (for example, radial variable) as a parameter. Averaging of the original BVP over the surface eigenfunctions leads to 1D BVP for a system of coupled second-order ordinary differential equations (SOODEs) containing the potential matrix elements and first-derivative coupling terms that are integrals of the products of the surface eigenfunctions and/or the first derivatives of the surface eigenfunctions with respect to a parameter [4]. The purpose of this paper is to present the finite element method procedure based on the use of high-order accuracy approximations for calculating eigenvalues, 'surface eigenfunctions and their first derivatives with respect to a parameter of the parametric BVP for self-adjoined 2D PDE with the Dirichlet and/or Neumann type boundary conditions on a finite 2D region which arise at the reduction of the 3D BVP to 1D BVP for a system of coupled SOODEs in the framework of CCAA. The program developed calculates potential matrix elements that are integrals of the products of the surface eigenfunctions and/or the first derivatives of the surface eigenfunctions with respect to a parameter. These eigenvalues and potential matrix elements can be used for solving the bound state and multi-channel scattering problems for a system of coupled SOODEs with the help of the KANTBP program [5].
Solution method: We seek the desirable solution of the parametric 2D BVP in the form of expansion in the basis functions of the auxiliary Sturm-Liouville problem with respect to one of the fast variables. They are chosen in analytical form or calculated by the ODPEVP program [6]. The coefficients of the expansion are vector-eigenfunctions of the parametric homogeneous 1D BVP for a system of coupled SOODEs obtained by averaging the original 2D problem over the basis functions. First derivatives with respect to the parameter of these vector-eigenfunctions and eigenvalues are solutions of the parametric inhomogeneous 1D BVP, obtained by taking a derivative of the parametric homogeneous 1D BVP with respect to the parameter [7]. Then, we solve the reduced parametric homogeneous and inhomogeneous 1D BVPs by the finite element method using high-order accuracy approximations [6]. The generalized algebraic eigenvalue problem AF = E BF with respect to a pair of unknowns (E, F) arising after the replacement of the differential problem by the finite-element approximation is solved by the subspace iteration method using the SSPACE program [1]. First derivatives of the vector-eigenfunctions and eigenvalues with respect to the parameter are obtained by solving the inhomogeneous algebraic equations in accordance with the algorithm used in [6]. Finally, we evaluate the desirable matrix elements using the calculated eigenvalues, vector-eigenfunctions and their derivatives, which can be applied to generate the coupled system equations in the slow variable in the CCAA.
Benchmark calculations of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the ground and first excited states of a Helium atom in the framework of a coupled-channel hyperspherical adiabatic approach are presented. Additionally a convergence of the eigenvalues versus both the number of parametric vector-eigenfunctions and the number of their components is studied. As a test desk, the program is applied to the calculation of the eigensolutions and their first derivatives with respect to the parameter of the parametric 2D BVP including evaluation of matrix elements, which are used in the benchmark calculations.
Restrictions: The computer memory requirements depend on:
(a) the number of differential equations,
(b) the number and order of finite elements, and
(c) the number of eigensolutions required.
Restrictions due to dimension sizes may be easily alleviated by altering PARAMETER statements (see Long Write-Up). The user must also supply subroutine POTCLC for evaluating potential matrix elements. The user must also supply additional three DOUBLE PRECISION functions (see Long Write-Up for details).
Running rime: The running time depends critically upon:
(a) the number of differential equations,
(b) the number and order of finite elements, and
(c) the number of eigensolutions required.
The test run which accompanies this paper took 15 s with calculation of matrix potentials on computer Intel Core i5 CPU 3.33 GHz, 4 GB RAM, Windows 7. This test run requires 10 MB of disk storage.

The present implementation facilitates a large number of computational tasks, including the definition, manipulation and parametrization of quantum states, the evaluation of quantum measures and quantum operations, the evolution of quantum noise in discrete models, quantum measurements and state estimation, and several others. The design is based on a few high-level commands, with a syntax close to the mathematical notation and its use in the literature, and which can be generalized quite readily in order to solve computational tasks at even higher degree of complexity.

Computer: Any computer capable of running the Maple package.
Operating system: Suse and Ubuntu Linux.
Typical time and memory requirements: Most commands respond promptly or require less than a few seconds on a standard processor if invoked with quantum states and registers of four or less qubits. In addition to the memory for using the Maple machinery, about 5-20 MB or working memory is typically sufficient to deal with standard (floating-point) computations. When working with symbolic expressions or some large number of qubits (n >approximate to 5), however, the requirements of cpu time and memory depend critically on the size and complexity of the expressions involved. Although Maple's assume feature may sometimes help reduce the complexity of symbolic expressions, more often than not, only numerical computations are feasible for sizeable expressions or a larger number of qubits. Since most commands can be readily applied to quite different computational scenarios, no general scaling rule can be given for the requested cpu time or memory.
Classification: 4.15.
Nature of problem:
Quantum information processing and quantum control require a careful preparation and analysis of quantum states. For such an analysis and for implementing new protocols, various computational tasks need to be performed frequently, such as the construction, manipulation and estimation of quantum states, the display of quantum amplitudes and probability distributions, the evaluation of quantum measures and quantum operations, the decomposition of operators into different representations, or the simulation of quantum measurements, to name just a few.
Solution method:
To support a large number of computational tasks in dealing with n-qubit quantum states and quantum registers, a high-level (computer-) language is designed and implemented within the framework of the computer-algebra system Maple. This design is based on a set of keystring-driven commands in order to provide a flexible, interactive and user-friendly environment for quantum computations on finite n-qubit systems. The present design provides high-level commands (procedures) that can be utilized in order to simulate reversible and irreversible quantum computations. Though the use of Maple has been found versatile to access a wealth of (additional) in-built mathematical functions, the re-design of the FEYNMAN tools is general and flexible enough to be implemented (or combined) with other languages and computational environments.
Restrictions:
Restrictions in the manipulation of n-qubit quantum states mainly arise from the complexity and stability of certain algebraic and numerical computations. For example, the symbolic analysis of noise models (as defined by means of the known Kraus operators) often leads to large expressions that slow down all subsequent computations. Owing to the exponential increase of complexity with the number of qubits involved, many computational tasks are limited to about 4-5 qubits on a standard processor, although some larger number of qubits might become feasible by using Maple's parallel features or some link to specially designed code in Matlab, C or Fortran.
Unusual features:
The FEYNMAN tools [1] have been re-designed within the framework of Maple to provide a small but very powerful set of keystring-driven commands for symbolic and numerical simulations of (finite) n-qubit systems. Emphasis was placed especially on establishing a set of (about 15-20) high-level commands that are suitable to deal with most common tasks from quantum information theory, and which can be applied also interactively. Whenever possible, both representations of quantum registers in terms of their state vectors and/or density matrices are equally supported by the program, and with no other restrictions than those given by the memory and processor resources of the computer.
All commands of the FEYNMAN tools are organized in an hierarchical order and can be utilized as language elements in order to perform tasks at even higher level of complexity. Moreover, the design and syntax of this toolbox may serve as a model to apply computer-algebraic techniques to other fields in science and technology.

WOS:000292437800014,Article,"Quantum computation,Mathematica,Quantum simulation,Quantum algorithms",,Technology,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications","Computer Science,Physics",Science & Technology,"This Mathematica 7.0/8.0 package upgrades and extends the quantum computer simulation code called QDENSITY. Use of the density matrix was emphasized in QDENSITY, although that code was also applicable to a quantum state description. In the present version, the quantum state version is stressed and made amenable to future extensions to parallel computer simulations. The add-on QCWAVE extends QDENSITY in several ways. The first way is to describe the action of one, two and three-qubit quantum gates as a set of small (2 x 2, 4 x 4 or 8 x 8) matrices acting on the 2(nq) amplitudes for a system of n(q) qubits. This procedure was described in our parallel computer simulation QCMPI and is reviewed here. The advantage is that smaller storage demands are made, without loss of speed, and that the procedure can take advantage of message passing interface (MPI) techniques, which will hopefully be generally available in future Mathematica versions.
Another extension of QDENSITY provided here is a multiverse approach, as described in our QCMPI paper. This multiverse approach involves using the present slave-master parallel processing capabilities of Mathematica 7.0/8.0 to simulate errors and error correction. The basic idea is that parallel versions of QCWAVE run simultaneously with random errors introduced on some of the processors, with an ensemble average used to represent the real world situation. Within this approach, error correction steps can be simulated and their efficacy tested. This capability allows one to examine the detrimental effects of errors and the benefits of error correction on particular quantum algorithms.
Other upgrades provided in this version include circuit-diagram drawing commands, better Dirac form and amplitude display features. These are included in the add-ons QCWave.m and Circuits.m, and are illustrated in tutorial notebooks.
In separate notebooks, QCWAVE is applied to sample algorithms in which the parallel multiverse setup is illustrated and error correction is simulated. These extensions and upgrades will hopefully help in both instruction and in application to QC dynamics and error correction studies.

This development is now reaching a wall so that smaller is no longer any faster. The clock rate has saturated at about 3-5 GHz and the parallel processor approach will soon reach its limit. The prime reason for the limitation the semiconductor electronics experiences is not the switching speed of the individual transistor, but its power dissipation and thus heat.
Digital superconductive electronics is a circuit- and device-technology that is inherently faster at much less power dissipation than semiconductor electronics. It makes use of superconductors and Josephson junctions as circuit elements, which can provide extremely fast digital devices in a frequency range - dependent on the material - of hundreds of GHz: for example a flip-flop has been demonstrated that operated at 750 GHz. This digital technique is scalable and follows similar design rules as semiconductor devices. Its very low power dissipation of only 0.1 mu W per gate at 100 GHz opens the possibility of three-dimensional integration. Circuits like microprocessors and analogue-to-digital converters for commercial and military applications have been demonstrated. In contrast to semiconductor circuits, the operation of superconducting circuits is based on naturally standardized digital pulses the area of which is exactly the flux quantum Phi(0). The flux quantum is also the natural quantization unit for digital-to-analogue and analogue-to-digital converters. The latter application is so precise, that it is being used as voltage standard and that the physical unit 'Volt' is defined by means of this standard.
Apart from its outstanding features for digital electronics, superconductive electronics provides also the most sensitive sensor for magnetic fields: the Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID). Amongst many other applications SQUIDs are used as sensors for magnetic heart and brain signals in medical applications, as sensor for geological surveying and food-processing and for non-destructive testing. As amplifiers of electrical signals. SQUIDs can nearly reach the theoretical limit given by Quantum Mechanics.
A further important field of application is the detection of very weak signals by 'transition-edge' bolo-meters, superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors, and superconductive tunnel junctions. Their application as radiation detectors in a wide frequency range, from microwaves to X-rays is now standard. The very low losses of superconductors have led to commercial microwave filter designs that are now widely used in the USA in base stations for cellular phones and in military communication applications. The number of demonstrated applications is continuously increasing and there is no area in professional electronics, in which superconductive electronics cannot be applied and surpasses the performance of classical devices.
Superconductive electronics has to be cooled to very low temperatures. Whereas this was a bottleneck in the past, cooling techniques have made a huge step forward in recent years: very compact systems with high reliability and a wide range of cooling power are available commercially, from microcoolers of match-box size with milli-Watt cooling power to high-reliability coolers of many Watts of cooling power for satellite applications. Superconductive electronics will not replace semiconductor electronics and similar room-temperature techniques in standard applications, but for those applications which require very high speed, low-power consumption, extreme sensitivity or extremely high precision, superconductive electronics is superior to all other available techniques.
To strengthen the European competitiveness in superconductor electronics research projects have to be set-up in the following field:
- Ultra-sensitive sensing and imaging.
- Quantum measurement instrumentation.
- Advanced analogue-to-digital converters.
- Superconductive electronics technology. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

WOS:000266660400016,Article,"Quantum algorithms,Parallel computing,Quantum simulation",STATE,Technology,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications","Computer Science,Physics",Science & Technology,"QCMPI is a quantum computer (QC) simulation package written in Fortran 90 with parallel processing capabilities. It is an accessible research tool that permits rapid evaluation of quantum algorithms for a large number of qubits and for various ""noise"" scenarios. The prime motivation for developing QCMPI is to facilitate numerical examination of not only how QC algorithms work, but also to include noise, decoherence, and attenuation effects and to evaluate the efficacy of error correction schemes. The present work builds on an earlier Mathematica code QDENSITY, which is mainly a pedagogic tool. In that earlier work, although the density matrix formulation was featured. the description using state vectors was also provided. In QCMPI, the stress is on state vectors, in order to employ a large number of qubits. The parallel processing feature is implemented by using the Message-Passing Interface (MPI) protocol. A description of how to spread the wave function components over many processors is provided, along with how to efficiently describe the action of general one- and two-qubit operators on these state vectors. These operators include the standard Pauli, Hadamard, CNOT and CPHASE gates and also Quantum Fourier transformation. These operators make up the actions needed in QC. Codes for Grover's search and Shor's factoring algorithms are provided as examples. A major feature of this work is that concurrent versions of the algorithms can be evaluated with each version subject to alternate noise effects, which corresponds to the idea of solving a stochastic Schrodinger equation. The density matrix for the ensemble of such noise cases is constructed using parallel distribution methods to evaluate its eigenvalues and associated entropy. Potential applications of this powerful tool include studies of the stability and correction of QC processes using Hamiltonian based dynamics.

However, despite the successful demonstration of several protocols, such as teleportation or quantum key distribution, there are still many open questions of how entanglement affects the efficiency of quantum algorithms or how it can be protected against noisy environments. The investigation of these and related questions often requires a search or optimization over the set of quantum states and, hence, a parametrization of them and various other objects. To facilitate this kind of studies in quantum information theory, here we present an extension of the FEYNMAN program that was developed during recent years as a toolbox for the simulation and analysis of quantum registers. In particular, we implement parameterizations of hermitian and unitary matrices (of arbitrary order), pure and mixed quantum states as well as separable states. In addition to being a prerequisite for the study of many optimization problems, these parameterizations also provide the necessary basis for heuristic studies which make use of random states, unitary matrices and other objects.

Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes
Nature of problem: During the last decades, quantum information science has contributed to our understanding of quantum mechanics and has provided also new and efficient protocols, based on the use of entangled quantum states. To determine the behavior and entanglement of n-qubit quantum registers, symbolic and numerical simulations need to be applied in order to analyze how these quantum information protocols work and which role the entanglement plays hereby.
Solution method: Using the computer algebra system Maple, we have developed a set of procedures that support the definition, manipulation and analysis of n-qubit quantum registers. These procedures also help to deal with (unitary) logic gates and (nonunitary) quantum operations that act upon the quantum registers. With the parameterization of various frequently-applied objects, that are implemented in the present version, the program now facilitates a wider range of symbolic and numerical studies. All commands can be used interactively in order to simulate and analyze the evolution of n-qubit quantum systems, both in ideal and noisy quantum circuits.
Reasons for new version: In the first version of the FEYNMAN program [I], we implemented the data structures and tools that are necessary to create, manipulate and to analyze the state of quantum registers. Later 12,3], support was added to deal with quantum operations (noisy channels) as an ingredient which is essential for studying the effects of decoherence. With the present extension, we add a number of parametrizations of objects frequently utilized in decoherence and entanglement studies, such that as hermitian and unitary matrices, probability distributions, or various kinds of quantum states. This extension therefore provides the basis, for example, for the optimization of a given function over the set of pure states or the simple generation of random objects.
Running time: Most commands that act upon quantum registers with five or less qubits take <= 10 seconds of processor time on a Pentium 4 processor with >= 2 GHz or newer, and about 5-20 MB of working memory (in addition to the memory for the Maple environment). Especially when working with symbolic expressions, however, the requirements on CPU time and memory critically depend on the size of the quantum registers, owing to the exponential growth of the dimension of the associated Hilbert space. For example, complex (symbolic) noise models, i.e. with several symbolic Kraus operators, result for multi-qubit systems often in very large expressions that dramatically slow down the evaluation of e.g. distance measures or the final-state entropy, etc. In these cases, Maple's assume facility sometimes helps to reduce the complexity of the symbolic expressions, but more often only a numerical evaluation is possible eventually. Since the complexity of the various commands of the FEYNMAN program and the possible usage scenarios can be very different, no general scaling law for CPU time or the memory requirements can be given.

A general simulator of quantum walks is very important for the development of this area, since it allows the researchers to focus on the mathematical and physical aspects of the research instead of deviating the efforts to the implementation of specific numerical simulations. In this paper we present QWalk, a quantum walk simulator for one- and two-dimensional lattices. Finite two-dimensional lattices with generic topologies can be used. Decoherence can be simulated by per-forming measurements or by breaking links of the lattice. We use examples to explain the usage of the software and to show some recent results of the literature that are easily reproduced by the simulator.

The wave function is composed of M layers of two elementary sets of time-evolution operators, each set being decomposed into commutable local operators acting on neighboring sites. The evolution time of each time-evolution operator is treated as a variational parameter so as to minimize the expectation value of the energy. We show that the exact ground state is reached by applying the layers of time-evolution operators as many as a quarter of the system size, implying that at least in this case, the state is exactly prepared in a quantum circuit with linear depth. This is the minimum number M-B of layers set by the limit of speed, i.e., the Lieb-Robinson bound, for propagating quantum entanglement via the local time-evolution operators. Indeed, we show the mutual information of the variational wave function that reveals a causality-cone-like structure in the propagation of quantum entanglement. Quantities such as the energy E and the entanglement entropy S of the optimized variational wave function with the number M of layers less than M-B are independent of the system size L but fall into some universal functions of M, indicating that the entanglement generated in this variational ansatz with a finite M is bounded, as in the case of the matrix product states with a finite bond dimension. Furthermore, in this case, we find that these two quantities behave asymptotically as E/L - epsilon(infinity) similar to M-2 (epsilon(infinity): the exact ground-state energy per site in the thermodynamic limit) and S approximate to 1/3 ln M. The development of the entanglement in the variational ansatz through the discretized quantum adiabatic process is further manifested in the progressive propagation of single-particle orbitals in the variational wave function. We also find that the optimized variational parameters converge systematically to a smooth function of the discretized time, which provides the optimum scheduling function in the quantum adiabatic process, with the effective total evolution time of the variational ansatz to the exact ground state being proportional to the system size L. This is a drastic improvement compared to the evolution time proportional to L-2 for the continuous-time quantum adiabatic process with a linear scheduling and is attributed to diabaticity of the discretized quantum adiabatic process represented in the variational ansatz. Finally, we investigate the imaginary-time evolution counterpart of this variational wave function, where the causality relation is absent due to the nonunitarity of the imaginary-time evolution operators, and thus the norm of the wave function is no longer conserved. We find that the convergence to the exact ground state is exponentially fast, despite that the system is at the critical point, suggesting that implementation of the nonunitary imaginary-time evolution in a quantum circuit is highly promising to further shallow the circuit depth, provided that the local nonunitary operators are represented with a reasonable amount of unitary operators.",2021,10.1103/PhysRevResearch.3.013004,PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH,Discretized quantum adiabatic process for free fermions and comparison with the imaginary-time evolution,Japan,AP,RIKEN,RIKEN,RIKEN,"Shirakawa, Tomonori",A-9744-2015,1,seq1_unique,504,True

Mixed quantum/classical simulations of the hydrated electron give different structures depending on the pseudopotential employed, and ab initio models of computational necessity use small numbers of water molecules and/or provide insufficient statistics to compare to experimental observables. A few years ago, Kumar et al. (J. Phys. Chem. A 2015, 119, 9148) proposed a minimalist ab initio model of the hydrated electron with only a small number of explicitly treated water molecules plus a polarizable continuum model (PCM). They found that the optimized geometry had four waters arranged tetrahedrally around a central cavity, and that the calculated vertical detachment energy and radius of gyration agreed well with experiment, results that were largely independent of the level of theory employed. The model, however, is based on a fixed structure at 0 K and does not explicitly incorporate entropic contributions or the thermal fluctuations that should be associated with the room-temperature hydrated electron. Thus, in this paper, we extend the model of Kumar et al. by running Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) of a small number of water molecules with an excess electron plus PCM at room temperature. We find that when thermal fluctuations are introduced, the level of theory chosen becomes critical enough when only four waters are used that one of the waters dissociates from the cluster with certain density functionals. Moreover, even with an optimally tuned range-separated hybrid functional, at room temperature the tetrahedral orientation of the 0 K first-shell waters is entirely lost and the central cavity collapses, a process driven by the fact that the explicit water molecules prefer to make H-bonds with each other more than with the excess electron. The resulting average structure is quite similar to that produced by a noncavity mixed quantum/classical model, so that the minimalist 4-water BOMD models suffer from problems similar to those of noncavity models, such as predicting the wrong sign of the hydrated electron's molar solvation volume. We also performed BOMD with 16 explicit water molecules plus an extra electron and PCM. We find that the inclusion of an entire second solvation shell of explicit water leads to little change in the outcome from when only four waters were used. In fact, the 16-water simulations behave much like those of water cluster anions, in which the electron localizes at the cluster surface, showing that PCM is not acceptable for use in minimalist models to describe the behavior of the bulk hydrated electron. For both the 4- and 16-water models, we investigate how the introduction of thermal motions alters the predicted absorption spectrum, vertical detachment energy, and resonance Raman spectrum of the simulated hydrated electron. We also present a set of structural criteria that can be used to numerically determine how cavity-like (or not) a particular hydrated electron model is. All of the results emphasize that the hydrated electron is a statistical object whose properties are inadequately captured using only a small number of explicit waters, and that a proper treatment of thermal fluctuations is critical to understanding the hydrated electron's chemical and physical behavior.",2020,10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c06356,JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B,Evaluating Simple <i>Ab Initio</i> Models of the Hydrated Electron: The Role of Dynamical Fluctuations,USA,AP,Univ Calif Los Angeles,University of California System,University of California System;University of California Los Angeles,"Park, Sanghyun J.",DMC-8670-2022,1,seq1_unique,536,True

Remarkably small features can be written in a variety of polymeric resists [V. R. Manfrinato et al., Nano Lett. 14, 4406 (2014); V. R. Manfrinato, A. Stein, L. Zhang, Y. Nam, K. G. Yager, E. A. Stach, and C. T. Black, Nano Lett. 17, 4562 (2017)]. However, this technology, which in this article the authors will refer to as conventional electron beam lithography (CEBL), is reaching its practical resolution and precision limits [V. R. Manfrinato et al., Nano Lett. 14, 4406 (2014)]. Hydrogen depassivation lithography (HDL) [J. N. Randall, J. W. Lyding, S. Schmucker, J. R. Von Ehr, J. Ballard, R. Saini, and Y. Ding, J. Vac. Sci. Technol. B 27, 2764 (2009); J. N. Randall, J. B. Ballard, J. W. Lyding, S. Schmucker, J. R. Von Ehr, R. Saini, H. Xu, and Y. Ding, Microelectron. Eng. 87, 955 (2010)] is a different version of electron beam lithography that is not limited in resolution and precision in the way that CEBL is. It uses a cold field emitter, a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) tip, to deliver a small spot of electrons on a Si (100) 2 x 1 H-passivated surface to expose a self-developing resist that is a monolayer of H adsorbed to the Si surface. Subnanometer features [S. Chen, H. Xu, K. E. J. Goh, L. Liu, and J. N. Randall, Nanotechnology 23, 275301 (2012)], and even the removal of single H atoms can be routinely accomplished [M. A. Walsh and M. C. Hersam, Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 60, 193 (2009)]. It is known that the H desorption process at low biases is a multielectron process [E. Foley, A. Kam, J. Lyding, and P. Avouris, Phys. Rev. Lett. 80, 1336 (1998)], but the tunneling distribution of the electrons from the STM tip to the Si surface lattice is not known. The authors have developed a simple model that demonstrates that the combination of two highly nonlinear processes creates a much higher contrast exposure mechanism than CEBL. Currently, HDL has been used almost exclusively on the Si (100) surface and has a limited number of pattern transfer techniques including Si and Ge patterned epitaxy, selective atomic layer deposition of TiO2 followed by reactive ion etching [J. B. Ballard, T. W. Sisson, J. H. G. Owen, W. R. Owen, E. Fuchs, J. Alexander, J. N. Randall, and J. R. Von Ehr, J. Vac. Sci. Technol.

Owen and W. P. Kirk]. While the throughput of HDL is very low, going parallel in a big way appears promising [J. N. Randall, J. H. G. Owen, J. Lake, R. Saini, E. Fuchs, M. Mandavi, S. 0. R. Moheimani, and B. C. Schaefer, J. Vac. Sci. Technol. B 36, 6 (2018)]. However, the most exciting aspect of HDL is its atomic -scale resolution and precision, which is key to nanoscale research.

It can solve time-independent or time-dependent linear Schrodinger and Liouville-von Neumann-equations in one or more dimensions. Also coupled equations can be treated, which allows, e.g., to simulate molecular quantum dynamics beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Optionally accounting for the interaction with external electric fields within the semi-classical dipole approximation, WavePacket can be used to simulate experiments involving tailored light pulses in photo-induced physics or chemistry. Being highly versatile and offering visualization of quantum dynamics 'on the fly', WavePacket is well suited for teaching or research projects in atomic, molecular and optical physics as well as in physical or theoretical chemistry. Building on the previous Part I [Comp. Phys. Comm. 213, 223-234 (2017)] which dealt with closed quantum systems and discrete variable representations, the present Part II focuses on the dynamics of open quantum systems, with Lindblad operators modeling dissipation and dephasing. This part also describes the WavePacket function for optimal control of quantum dynamics, building on rapid monotonically convergent iteration methods. Furthermore, two different approaches to dimension reduction implemented in WavePacket are documented here. In the first one, a balancing transformation based on the concepts of controllability and observability Gramians is used to identify states that are neither well controllable nor well observable. Those states are either truncated or averaged out. In the other approach, the H2-error for a given reduced dimensionality is minimized by H2 optimal model reduction techniques, utilizing a bilinear iterative rational Krylov algorithm.
The present work describes the MATLAB version of WavePacket 5.3.0 which is hosted and further developed at the Sourceforge platform, where also extensive Wiki-documentation as well as numerous worked-out demonstration examples with animated graphics can be found.

Does the new version supersede the previous version?: The previous article focused on the treatment of closed quantum systems by discrete variable representations and implementation of various numerical algorithms for solving Schrobdinger's equations. Complementary to that, the present second part is concerned with open quantum systems and optimal control by external fields. In addition, two approaches to dimension reduction useful in modeling of quantum control are described.
Reasons for the new version: The reason for having a second article on the WavePacket software package lies in the fact that a complete description of the package would have exceeded the scope of a regular article. Several significant features of the WAVEPACKET package are introduced here which could not be mentioned in the first article, due to length constraints.
Summary of revisions: Here we describe the numerical treatment of open quantum systems dynamics modeled by Lindblad master equations. Moreover, we explain the WAVEPACKET functions for optimal control simulations, both for closed and open quantum systems. To address the problem of computational effort, two strategies for model reduction have been included.
Nature of problem: Dynamics of closed and open systems are described by Schrodinger or Liouvillevon Neumann equations, respectively, where the latter ones will be restricted to the Lindblad master equation. Emphasis is on the interaction of quantum system with external electric fields, treated within the semi-classical dipole approximation. Quantum optimal control simulations are used for the design of tailored fields achieving specified targets in quantum dynamics. With these features, WAVEPACKET can be instrumental for the simulation, understanding, and prediction of modern experiments in atomic, molecular and optical physics involving temporally shaped fields.
Solution method: Representing state vectors or reduced density matrices in a discrete basis, SchrOdinger or Liouville-von Neumann equations are cast into systems of ordinary differential equations. Those are treated by self-written or MATLAB'S built-in solvers, the latter ones offering adaptive time-stepping. The optimal control equations are solved by the rapid monotonically convergent iteration methods developed by Zhu, Rabitz, Ohtsuki and others. In order to reduce the dimensionality of large scale control problems, the balanced truncation method as well as H2-optimal model reduction approaches are available in WAVEPACKET.
Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: The WAVEPACKET program package is rather easy and intuitive to use, providing visualization of quantum dynamics 'on the fly'. It is mainly intended for low-dimensional systems, typically not exceeding three to five degrees of freedom. Detailed user guides and reference manuals are available through numerous Wiki pages hosted at the SOURCEFORGE platform where also a large number of well documented demonstration examples can be found.

Here I present a very personal viewpoint, focusing on my own path to quantum entanglement and then on to applications. I have been fascinated by quantum physics ever since I heard about it for the first time in school. The theory struck me immediately for two reasons: (1) its immense mathematical beauty, and (2) the unparalleled precision to which its predictions have been verified again and again. Particularly fascinating for me were the predictions of quantum mechanics for individual particles, individual quantum systems. Surprisingly, the experimental realization of many of these fundamental phenomena has led to novel ideas for applications. Starting from my early experiments with neutrons, I later became interested in quantum entanglement, initially focusing on multi-particle entanglement like GHZ states. This work opened the experimental possibility to do quantum teleportation and quantum hyper-dense coding. The latter became the first entanglement-based quantum experiment breaking a classical limitation. One of the most fascinating phenomena is entanglement swapping, the teleportation of an entangled state. This phenomenon is fundamentally interesting because it can entangle two pairs of particles which do not share any common past. Surprisingly, it also became an important ingredient in a number of applications, including quantum repeaters which will connect future quantum computers with each other. Another application is entanglement-based quantum cryptography where I present some recent long-distance experiments. Entanglement swapping has also been applied in very recent so-called loophole-free tests of Bell's theorem. Within the physics community such loophole-free experiments are perceived as providing nearly definitive proof that local realism is untenable. While, out of principle, local realism can never be excluded entirely, the 2015 achievements narrow down the remaining possibilities for local realistic explanations of the quantum phenomenon of entanglement in a significant way. These experiments may go down in the history books of science. Future experiments will address particularly the freedom-of-choice loophole using cosmic sources of randomness. Such experiments confirm that unconditionally secure quantum cryptography is possible, since quantum cryptography based on Bell's theorem can provide unconditional security. The fact that the experiments were loophole-free proves that an eavesdropper cannot avoid detection in an experiment that correctly follows the protocol. I finally discuss some recent experiments with single- and entangled-photon states in higher dimensions. Such experiments realized quantum entanglement between two photons, each with quantum numbers beyond 10 000 and also simultaneous entanglement of two photons where each carries more than 100 dimensions. Thus they offer the possibility of quantum communication with more than one bit or qubit per photon. The paper concludes discussing Einstein's contributions and viewpoints of quantum mechanics. Even if some of his positions are not supported by recent experiments, he has to be given credit for the fact that his analysis of fundamental issues gave rise to developments which led to a new information technology. Finally, I reflect on some of the lessons learned by the fact that nature cannot be local, that objective randomness exists and about the emergence of a classical world. It is suggestive that information plays a fundamental role also in the foundations of quantum physics.",2017,10.1088/1402-4896/aa736d,PHYSICA SCRIPTA,Light for the quantum.

Conjointly, due to nonlinear systems' exhibiting more exotic behavior than harmonic distortion, it becomes compelling to test, classify and interpret the results in an accurate way. For this reason, avoiding preconceived ideas of the way the system is likely to respond is of pivotal importance since this facet would have effect on the type of testing run and processing techniques used in nonlinear systems. Paradigms of nonlinear science may suggest that it is 'the study of every single phenomenon' due to its interdisciplinary nature, which is another challenge encountered and needs to be addressed by generating and designing a systematic mathematical framework where the complexity of natural phenomena hints the requirement of identifying their commonalties and classifying their various manifestations in different nonlinear systems. Studying such common properties, concepts or paradigms can enable one to gain insight into nonlinear problems, their essence and consequences in a broad range of disciplines all forthwith. Fractional differential equations associated with non-local phenomena in physics have arisen as a powerful mathematical tool within a multidisciplinary research framework. Fractional differential equations, as one extension of the fractional calculus theory, can yield the evolution of various systems properly, which reinforces its position in mathematics and science while setting stage for the description of dynamic, complicated and nonlinear events. Through the reflection of the systems' actual properties, fractional calculus manifests unforeseeable and hidden variations, and thus, enables integration and differentiation, with the solutions to be approximated by numerical methods along with modeling and predicting the dynamics of multiphysics, multiscale and physical systems. Neural Networks (NNs), consisting of hidden layers with nonlinear functions that have vector inputs and outputs, are also considerably employed owing to their versatile and efficient characteristics in classification problems as well as their sophisticated neural network architectures, which make them capable of tackling complicated governing partial differential equation problems. Furthermore, partial differential equations are used to provide comprehensive and accurate models for many scientific phenomena owing to the advancements of data gathering and machine learning techniques which have raised opportunities for data-driven identification of governing equations derived from experimentally observed data. Given these considerations, while many problems are solvable and have been solved, efforts are still needed to be able to respond to the remaining open questions in the fields that have a broad range of spectrum ranging from mathematics, physics, biology, virology, epidemiology, chemistry, engineering, social sciences to applied sciences.
With a view of different aspects of such questions, our special issue provides a collection of recent research focusing on the advances in the foundational theory, methodology and topical applications of fractals, fractional calculus, fractional differential equations, differential equations (PDEs, ODEs, to name some), delay differential equations (DDEs), chaos, bifurcation, stability, sensitivity, machine learning, quantum machine learning, and so forth in order to expound on advanced fractional calculus, differential equations and neural networks with detailed analyses, models, simulations, data-driven approaches as well as numerical computations.",2023,10.1088/1402-4896/acfe73,PHYSICA SCRIPTA,"Advanced fractional calculus, differential equations and neural networks: analysis, modeling and numerical computations",Romania; Turkiye,,Cankaya Univ; Inst Space Sci,Cankaya University; Institute of Space Science,Cankaya University; Institute of Space Science,"Baleanu, Dumitru",B-9936-2012,1,merged_seq1_same_id,523,True

In advancing these efforts, laws and policies govern these environments placing protections, standards, and developmental opportunities for higher education, students, faculty, and even the nation-state. Nonetheless, evidence of educational restrictions, encumbered actions, and archaic approaches pervades the legal literature and case law demonstrating that these laws and policies do not always function well in evolving and emerging technology spaces. To examine these laws and policies of student privacy, the author employs the combination of a critical policy analysis, which derives from critical social research as a means to explore discourse and policy through drawing out the policy contexts, texts, and consequences, and Flood's liberating systems theory, which directs the analysis to a problem-solving approach by examining the policy discourse from a systems-thinking lens. Based on a review of 184 court cases, 74 policies from a diversified representation of US states/territories, and seven developed nations or multi-nation consortia, this examination illuminates how context and text such as the type and setting of the privacy matter (eg, various freedom of information acts, educational records under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, and General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union) presents opportunities for protections and standardization efforts; however, they also illustrate significant protection gaps, guesswork and insufficiency around the type and degree of data subject consent, and ghosting effects of data subjects' protections. While the extant literature already supports aspects of these findings, it does not account for this holistic view of these three privacy vulnerabilities-especially in light of the principles to which these laws purport to achieve. Moreover, the three identified privacy vulnerabilities suggest overlooked inclusion of two overarching privacy concepts-transparency and equity. This study recommends that key actors in the policy construction realm (ie, university leaders, policymakers, and judges) should engage in analyses, dialogue, and consideration about transparency and equity by considering contemporary privacy problems in the contexts of artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and cybersecurity as a way to improve transparent and equitable policies in these areas rather than exacerbating the privacy dilemmas already in place.Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topicIn the United States, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) are well documented evidence of privacy protections for education and health records, but they fail to offer sufficient protections for students as data subjects with emerging technologies.Existing federal-level laws in the United States do not offer a systematic or uniform approach in the manner that data users obtain consent, so data subjects are largely unaware of what is being consented.Other than matters of consent, policy strategies based on student privacy laws (ie, voluntary consensus standards, basic practices to maintain privacy, an ethics review board, data/record retention and destruction, and data sanitation of equipment) are significant and informative largely from the university-perspective, not the students as data subjects.

The THz electromagnetic wave is located between microwave and infrared, and its spectrum width is about thirty times greater than that of microwave and millimeter waves. It is a strategic frequency resource that various countries are scrambling for, and enormous demands occur in both military and civil applications. However, this frequency band, which connects electronics and photonics, has not been fully exploited and utilized. The THz frequency band has many unique characteristics, such as the time-resolving ability with narrow pulse widths at the picosecond level, the ability to penetrate paper and clothing, the spectral properties of many matters, and the low photon energy. These unique properties give THz waves many important applications, such as nondestructive testing, communication radar, security checks and anti-terrorist, and biomedicine. However, the key factor which hinders the development of THz science and applications is the lack of high-performance THz sources, core devices, and system integration. Among them, the lack of high-efficiency, high-beam quality, and high-stability strong-field THz radiation sources is the focus and difficulty of the current solution. The methods of generating THz radiation include mainly the electrical and optical methods. This paper mainly discusses the optical methods to generate THz radiation. Optical methods for generating THz radiation include femtosecond laser excitation of nonlinear crystals, photoconductive antennas, plasmas, and so on, which are widely used in sensing imaging and communication. However, the low efficiency and low energy of the current THz radiation source directly limit the nonlinear effects of THz-matter interaction, novel quantum matter state regulation, electron acceleration, biomedicine and other multifaceted frontier scientific and applied research. Therefore, researchers in related fields are working to improve the performance of THz sources and to further promote the development of THz technology. After the presentation of the tilted pulse front technique, lithium niobate crystals with large nonlinear coefficients, mature manufacturing processes, and high destruction thresholds are expected to realize the generation of high-energy strong-field THz radiation through femtosecond laser action. Currently, pumping lithium niobate crystals by femtosecond laser based on the tilted pulse front technique is still one of the effective ways to generate high-energy strong-field THz radiation. Therefore, it is crucial and necessary to summarize the relevant research on lithium niobate strong-field THz sources to promote the development of this field. Progress In this paper, the study on lithium niobate strong-field THz sources is summarized as follows. Firstly, the development of strong-field THz generation based on femtosecond-laser-pumped lithium niobate crystals is reviewed in five stages (Fig. 1 ). Shen's research group at the University of California generated the world's first THz pulsed radiation from lithium niobate crystals by laser pulses. Hebling's group at the University of Pecs, Hungary, proposed the tilted pulse front technique to solve the phase mismatch between near-infrared (NIR) light and THz in lithium niobate crystals.
Then, the development of strong-field THz generation via tilted pulse front technique based on femtosecond-laser-pumped lithium niobate crystals has been initiated. Secondly, the principle of lithium niobate tilted pulse front is described in four aspects: the history of the tilted pulse front theory of lithium niobate (Fig. 2 ), the key factors to be considered in the theoretical model (Fig. 3 ), the phase matching and pulse front tilt angle (Fig. 4 ), and the main methods of model calculation, respectively. Guidance is provided for generating high-energy strong-field THz sources in the future by summarizing the historical evolution of the theoretical model for generating strong-field THz based on the tilted pulse front technique and the mechanism of radiation efficiency saturation of lithium niobate THz strong sources. Thirdly, the generation of lithium niobate single-period strong-field THz is described. A typical optical path diagram (Fig. 5) based on lithium niobate to generate a single-period strong-field THz and the composition of the tilted pulse front device are introduced. Fourthly, the lithium niobate multi-period strong-field THz generation is described. Two methods to generate multi period strong-field THz are introduced: the one based on the tilted pulse front technology of lithium niobate (Fig. 6) and the one based on the quasi-phase matching of periodically polarized lithium niobate (Fig. 7 ). Lithium niobate crystals are one of the most popular materials for generating strong-field THz, both for single-period and multi-period. Fifthly, the applications of lithium niobate strong-field THz are discussed, which are presented in three aspects: strong-field THz-matter interactions (Fig. 9 ), strong-field THz electron acceleration and manipulation (Fig. 10 ), and strong-field THz biological effects (Fig. 11). These applications demonstrate the advantages of this type of strong-field THz sources and raise the need for higher strong-field THz sources. Finally, the strong-field THz sources and applications at Beihang University are summarized and the results of Beihang University and its collaborative team in this field are introduced (Fig. 12 ). We are looking forward to the unprecedented new challenges and opportunities that extreme THz science and applications and their multidisciplinary intersection will bring in the future. Conclusions and Prospects Pumping lithium niobate crystals by femtosecond laser via tilted pulse front technique is one of the effective ways to generate strong-field THz. In summary, lithium niobate crystals are one of the popular materials for generating strong-field THz sources, and lithium niobate strong-field THz sources have played an important role in the applications and studies such as the strong-field THz interactions with matter, electron acceleration and manipulation, and biomedicine. In order to promote better development in strong-field THz sources, the study of lithium niobate strong-field THz source still needs to be deeply explored from the aspects of theoretical basis, structure, and application scenarios.",2022,10.3788/CJL202249.1914001,CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG,Lithium Niobate Strong-Field Terahertz Source and Its Applications,Peoples R China,AC,Beihang Univ,Beihang University,Beihang University,"Wu, Xiaojun",AFL-8746-2022,1,seq1_unique,953,True

The Quantum Optimal Control Suite (QuOCS) unites experimental focus and model-based approaches in a unified framework. Easy usage and installation presented here and the availability of various combinable optimization strategies is designed to improve the performance of many quantum technology platforms, such as color defects in diamond, superconducting qubits, atom-or ion-based quantum computers. It can also be applied to the study of more general phenomena in physics. In this paper, we describe the software and the toolbox of gradient -free and gradient-based algorithms. We then show how the user can connect it to their experiment. In addition, we provide illustrative examples where our optimization suite solves typical quantum optimal control problems, in both open-and closed-loop settings. Integration into existing experimental control software is already provided for the experiment control software Qudi (Binder et al., 2017 [41]), and further extensions are investigated and highly encouraged.

Those operations may in turn provide building blocks for various quantum information processing tasks such as quantum computation, communication, simulation, sensing, and metrology. Numerous control strategies exist to design and improve such operations [3]. While some strategies are constructed to target a rather specific problem with high efficiency, others are more general to solve a wide range of applications [4,5]. To access the different algorithms, one has to download different optimization suites with different input and output parameters, making them hard to compare and combine. To benefit from the variety of algorithms, we have devised a customizable and intuitive optimization suite that simultaneously provides access to some of the most popular quantum optimal control algorithms.Solution method: We combine, in a unified framework, some of the frequently used optimal control algorithms which are the dressed Chopped Random Basis method (dCRAB) [6], and Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering (GRAPE) [7], with an extension to make use of Automatic Differentiation (AD) [8]. The software is able to connect to both models of quantum dynamics in simulations and real-time quantum experiments to perform open-and closed-loop optimization, respectively. With minimal knowledge of optimal control theory, the user can manage to run optimizations of quantum processes using a variety of additional features such as stopping criteria and drift compensation. Logging and data management of the optimization progress and results are also handled by the suite. Its modular structure allows for extensions that accommodate customized algorithms and can be implemented by the user straightforwardly.

The development of quantum sensing protocols is greatly sped-up by software simulations of the new techniques. Quantum sensing simulation benefits from temporally-rich control of individual quanta. However, current specialized time-dependent Schrodinger equation solvers are instead optimized only for simple pulses in large Hilbert spaces. Thus, there is a need for efficient simulation of individual or ensemble quanta driven by adiabatic sweeps, elaborate pulse sequences, complex signals and non-Gaussian noise.Solution method: Spinsim simulates the quantum dynamics of spin-1/2 and spin-1 systems evolving under time-dependent control. We first speed up the integration of the time-dependent Schrodinger equation by splitting the calculation parallel-in-time on a GPU using the numba [1] just-in-time compiler. We achieve fast and robust evolution using a geometric integrator to bound errors over many steps. A dynamic rotating frame transformation and Lie-Trotter decomposition are used to decrease effective step sizes on long and short time scales, respectively. Hence, each individual step is more accurate. Spinsim is interfaced via a python package, meaning it can be used by researchers inexperienced with geometric integrators and GPU parallelism.Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: To use the (default) Nvidia cuda GPU parallelization, one needs to have a cuda compatible Nvidia GPU [2].

With rapid development of these applications, a more accurate characterization of chaotic lasers is needed. At present, chaotic lasers are mainly evaluated through an analysis of their dynamic properties in time and frequency domains. The quantum statistics of chaotic lasers are also investigated through high-order coherence and photon number distribution. However, the phase-space quasi-probability distributions of chaotic lasers remain to be further studied. The phase-space Wigner quasi-probability distributions of quantum states, such as the squeezed state, Schrodinger cat state, single-photon state, and multi-photon Fock state, have been reconstructed experimentally. However, system losses and the influence of noise in a practical experiment should be considered, and the high-fidelity measurement of the Wigner quasi-probability distribution in a phase space of chaotic lasers still needs to be further studied MethodsIn this work, the phase-space Wigner quasi-probability distributions of chaotic lasers in the quasiperiodic, moderate, and coherent collapse states are reconstructed experimentally through balanced homodyne quantum tomography and the maximum likelihood method. First, by controlling the bias current and optical feedback strength, the quasiperiodic, moderate, and coherence collapse chaotic lasers with different bandwidths are prepared. Then, the chaotic lasers in these three different states are used as signal light and allowed to interfere with a local oscillator beam. Finally, the beams enter the balanced homodyne detector after 50:50 beam splitting. The local oscillator phase is scanned by piezoelectric ceramic transducer to obtain the amplitude quadrature at all phase angles. Based on the measured quadrature results of the chaotic lasers, the Wigner quasi-probability distributions in phase space and the density matrices of the chaotic lasers are reconstructed using the maximum likelihood method.Results and DiscussionsFrom the quasiperiodic state to coherence collapse, the auto-correlation of chaotic lasers changes from multi-periodic oscillation to periodic weakening chaos. The peak values of the time-delay signature decrease from 0.567 to 0.213, and the chaotic intensity and bandwidth increase continuously (Fig.2). With an increase in the chaotic bandwidth and intensity, the measured phase-space Wigner quasi-probability distributions of the chaotic lasers are magnified by 1.5-3.0 times compared to the shot noise limit, and this chaotic amplification effect is continuously enhanced (Figs.3 and 4). After removing the -44 dBm background noise, the fidelity of the Wigner quasi-probability distributions of the chaotic lasers is improved from 74.9%,81.2%, and 84.8% to 79.9%,86.8%, and 90.4%, respectively (Fig.5). Then, after compensating for the 8.9% loss of the experimental system, the optimal fidelity of the reconstructed Wigner quasi-probability distribution function reaches up to 97.6%, realizing the high-fidelity phase-space reconstruction of chaotic lasers (Fig.6).ConclusionsIn summary, the phase-space Wigner quasi-probability distributions of chaotic lasers in different states are reconstructed accurately. Three chaotic lasers, i.e.
quasi-periodic, moderate, and coherent collapse chaotic lasers, are prepared experimentally, and their bandwidths are 3.2 GHz,7.3 GHz, and 11.5 GHz, respectively. With an increase in bandwidth and a decrease in the time-delay period, the complexity of the chaotic laser increases. The quadrature signals of the chaotic lasers in the three states are measured, and the Wigner quasi-probability distributions in phase space and the density matrices of the chaotic lasers are reconstructed using balanced homodyne detection and the maximum likelihood method. Compared to the shot noise limit, the measured phase-space Wigner quasi-probability distributions of the chaotic lasers are magnified by 1.5-3.0 times. Meanwhile, the randomness of chaos increases, and the effect of chaotic amplification increases gradually. Finally, the high-fidelity phase-space reconstruction of the Wigner quasi-probability distributions of chaotic lasers with the fidelities of 95.5%,97.0%, and 97.6% is achieved after removing the -44 dBm background noise and compensating for the 8.9% loss of the experimental system.

Thanks to the ultrathin footprints and versatile design degrees of freedom, a variety of metasurfaces have been designed and implemented to achieve novel optical devices or applications such as metalenses, meta-holograms, polarizers, waveplates, spin-to- orbit angular momentum converters, image encryption and polarimeters. By choosing the material constituents and geometries of the meta-atoms, one can easily manipulate the degrees of freedom of light fields, such as amplitude, polarization, phase, and frequency. The ability to exploit frequency as an additional channel relies on nonlinear optical processes, which involve the generation of nonlinear waves at new frequencies. Previous studies in nonlinear optics mainly focus on improving the conversion efficiencies of nonlinear processes, and the manipulation of the generated nonlinear waves is usually realized by linear optical elements. One of the most prominent advantages of nonlinear photonic metasurfaces is their capability to manipulate nonlinear waves while generating them, and therefore people can greatly shrink the devices into a more compact form.
The phase matching condition is of critical importance in traditional nonlinear optical processes based on photonic crystals (Table 1). The quasi- phase matching technique is proposed to improve conversion efficiency when the rigorous phase matching condition is not met (Fig. 1). Nonlinear photonic crystals are a class of artificially engineered structures that can be modulated spatially. They are capable of fulfilling the phase matching condition and realizing nonlinear wavefront shaping simultaneously. As for metasurfaces, because of the subwavelength-scale feature size, the phase matching condition is less rigorous than that in conventional nonlinear crystals. There are many materials and mechanisms that can be chosen to enhance nonlinear responses and to enrich the functionalities of nonlinear photonic metasurfaces (Fig. 2). With the rapid development of nonlinear metasurfaces in recent years, it is time to review the progress in the area. This paper discusses the fundamentals of the effects of symmetries and geometric phases on the nonlinear responses of the metasurfaces and the applications in nonlinear wavefront shaping, quantum information processing, and terahertz wave generation and manipulation based on nonlinear metasurfaces.
Progress The important roles of symmetries and geometric phases in nonlinear photonic metasurfaces are first discussed. While the symmetries of the meta-atoms can decide the allowed and forbidden nonlinear processes, they can also affect the chiral optical responses of the metasurfaces ( Fig. 3). The nonlinear geometric phase is dependent on the order of the harmonic generations, the circular polarizations of the fundamental and nonlinear waves, and the spatial orientations of the meta-atoms (Fig. 4). It provides a convenient route to continuously control the phase imparted into the nonlinear waves (Table 2), which underpins the multi-dimensional nonlinear wavefront shaping by metasurfaces.
The applications based on nonlinear metasurfaces are then discussed. The direct applications of nonlinear metasurfaces are wavefront shaping devices ( Fig. 5). With the ability to control the phases in nonlinear optical processes such as second harmonic generation, third harmonic generation, sum frequency generation, difference frequency generation, and four- wave mixing, the nonlinear metasurfaces have enabled nonlinear wavefront shaping like focusing, imaging, beam steering, vortex beam generation, holography, and image encryption. By exploiting the quantum entanglement characteristics of spontaneous down conversion processes, one can also use metasurfaces to generate highdimensional entangled photons (Fig. 6). Several applications such as high- dimensional spatially entangled photon pairs and orbital angular momentum-carrying entangled photon pairs based on plasmonic and dielectric metasurfaces have been experimentally demonstrated. The nonlinear metasurfaces can be used for terahertz wave generation and manipulation as well. Terahertz waves possess unique advantages in applications such as nondestructive measurements and communications, but the development of terahertz technology is impeded by the lack of terahertz sources, detectors, and elements. Nonlinear metasurfaces represent a novel platform for simultaneously generating and manipulating terahertz waves. The concept of geometric phase has been successfully applied to the terahertz wave generation process ( Fig. 7), which may lead to more functional devices in the terahertz spectral region.
Conclusions and Prospects To push forward the practical applications of nonlinear photonic metasurfaces, the key issue is to improve nonlinear conversion efficiency. All-dielectric metasurfaces can avoid the thermal heating effect that leads to the breakdown of the nanostructures in plasmonic metasurfaces and operate at a high pumping intensity to achieve high conversion efficiency. However, the nonlinear phase control ability of dielectric metasurfaces is very sensitive to the geometries of the nanostructures, which poses challenges to nanofabrication. The nonlinear geometric phases demonstrated on plasmonic metasurfaces provide an elegant way to manipulate the phase of nonlinear optical waves, which may be applied to more material systems. Moreover, the hybrid system of linear metasurfaces combined with traditional nonlinear crystals can provide a route to achieve highly efficient nonlinear wavefront engineering. Novel materials like new crystals or physical mechanisms such as electric field-induced second harmonic generation may also be exploited to improve the efficiency of second harmonic generation.",2023,,ACTA OPTICA SINICA,Nonlinear Photonic Metasurfaces: Fundamentals and Applications,Peoples R China,AC,Southern Univ Sci & Technol,Southern University of Science & Technology,Southern University of Science & Technology,Tang Yutao,GRF-4273-2022,1,seq1_unique,810,True
WOS:000967910400011,Article,"oceanic optics,underwater quantum communication,sea ice,link attenuation,channel utilization,bit error rate of system,system bit rate",,Physical Sciences,Optics,Optics,Science & Technology,"Objective Quantum communication uses the quantum state as an information source to achieve the effective transmission of the information of quantum state carries. It has the advantages of high security, high transmission speed, and large communication capacity and is thus a hotspot in the current communication field. However, when an equivalent optical signal is transmitted underwater, it is inevitably affected by environmental factors, resulting in the degradation of transmission performance. Sea ice is one of the important factors that affect the transmission of optical quantum signals underwater. It is composed of freshwater ice crystals, brine bubbles, and bubbles containing salt. When an optical quantum signal is transmitted underwater, the bubbles, brine bubbles, and other microbial particles in sea ice absorb and scatter the optical signal, seriously interfering with the transmission of the signal and resulting in reduced communication performance. The propagation, reflection, and absorption of optical quantum signals in sea ice are affected by the particles and sol organics condensed in the sea ice. However, the influence of sea ice on the performance of underwater quantum communication channels has rarely been reported. Therefore, it is of great significance to analyze the extinction characteristics of sea ice as a whole according to the absorption and scattering characteristics of each component of sea ice and study the influence of sea ice with different density and salinity on link attenuation, channel utilization, and the bit error rate and bit rate of a quantum key distribution system.
Methods Sea ice is composed of bubbles, brine bubbles, and other particles. To study the influence of sea ice on the performance of underwater quantum communication channels, this paper analyzes the absorption and scattering characteristics of each component of sea ice. Subsequently, on the basis of the absorption and scattering characteristics of sea ice with different density and salinity, it explores and simulates the relationships of sea ice parameters with the extinction coefficient. Then, according to the extinction characteristics of sea ice with different density and salinity, a constant incident wavelength is adopted, and the relationships of sea ice parameters with link attenuation and channel utilization are determined and simulated experimentally. Finally, the paper examines the effects of sea ice with different density and salinity on the bit error rate and bit rate of a quantum key distribution system and implements data simulation. The theoretical analysis and simulation results can provide a reference for the design of underwater quantum communication in sea ice environments.
Results and Discussions Under the same incident wavelength, the extinction coefficient of sea ice increases with sea ice density and sea ice salinity, and it is more markedly affected by the change in sea ice salinity ( Fig. 2). When the transmission distance is short and sea ice salinity is small, the link attenuation caused by sea ice is also small. As the transmission distance of the optical quantum signal and sea ice salinity increase, link attenuation increases rapidly (Fig. 4). As sea ice density rises, the extinction effect on the quantum state of the light becomes more obvious, which leads to a decrease in channel utilization (Fig. 5). Since the scattering of light by sea ice changes the polarization of photons constituting the qubit and causes bit errors, the bit error rate of the underwater quantum system increases with sea ice salinity ( Fig. 8). The bit rate of the key distribution system is affected by sea ice salinity and transmission distance. When sea ice salinity is small and transmission distance is short, the system bit rate changes slowly. When sea ice salinity is large and transmission distance is long, the attenuation of the optical quantum signal is serious, and the value of the bit rate decreases rapidly (Fig. 10).
Conclusions According to the extinction characteristics of sea ice, this paper determines the relationships of sea ice density and sea ice salinity with link attenuation, channel utilization, and the bit error rate and bit rate of the quantum key distribution system. Furthermore, it comparatively analyzes the influence of sea ice on the performance of underwater quantum communication under different parameters. The simulation results show that the link attenuation and the bit rate of the underwater quantum key distribution system tend to decrease as transmission distance and sea ice salinity or sea ice density increase. Moreover, the utilization rate of the quantum communication channel and the system bit rate decrease to varying degrees. In comparison, the change in sea ice salinity interferes more strongly with communication quality and influences the channel parameters more saliently. Therefore, the effects of sea ice density and sea ice salinity on the quantum state of light, especially the effects of sea ice salinity, must be fully considered when underwater quantum communication is conducted.",2023,10.3788/AOS221521,ACTA OPTICA SINICA,Effect of Sea Ice on Performance of Underwater Quantum Communication Channels,Peoples R China,AC,Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol,Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology,Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology,Zhang Xiuzai,GKX-6103-2022,1,seq1_unique,785,True

This study was aimed at optimization of a search for configurations of quantum and information channels for a grid corresponding to dense wavelength division multiplexing standards using optimization methods based on analysis of the channel noise effect on quantum key distribution sessions and investigation of these methods. Method. Naturally, quantum signal powers are significantly lower than those of classic signals. Therefore, noise from information channels for a configuration where they propagate in the same fiber with quantum channels results in considerable reduction of quantum key distribution system performance. This problem can be mitigated by reducing the noise level in the channel via the selection and use of an optimal spectral channel allocation. The search for such channel allocation schemes, which are further referred to as configurations, can be implemented via several methods, such as the educated guess method and the approach entailing optimization using the simulated annealing optimization algorithm, which are the subjects of this study. The results obtained using this method were compared with similar results obtained using the educated guess method. Descriptions of the methods and their interpretation for the context of the objectives of the study are presented together with mathematical models for calculation of noise resulting from spontaneous Raman scattering, four-wave mixing, and linear channel crosstalk. Optimal allocation schemes of quantum and information channels in the grid with dense wavelength division multiplexing (configurations) obtained using the two methods are described. The configurations were considered optimal when the total value of all channel noise types considered in the mathematical model was minimal. Main results. Optimal configurations obtained using methods of simulated annealing and educated guess are described in this study. We demonstrated that the educated guess method is applicable when the spontaneous Raman scattering is the primary contributor to the total losses. In this case, the information channels should be arranged according to the Raman scattering cross-section graph. However, when the contribution of four-wave mixing is comparable with or exceeds that of spontaneous Raman scattering, the simulated annealing algorithm is preferrable to search for the optimal configurations. In this case, information channels should be located at a distance from the quantum channel: the smaller the grid spacing, the further the information channels are positioned from the quantum channel to obtain optimal configurations. Increase in the number of channels results in reduction in this separation distance inside the grid with fixed channel spacing. Practical significance. Currently, practical implementations of fiber-optic communication lines are inextricably connected with multiplexing technologies, particularly, dense wavelength division multiplexing, to satisfy the constantly growing demand in increasing information capacity of communication channels and constructing quantum networks.
Assignment of separate fibers for quantum key distribution systems is not optimal; thus, existing technologies of channel multiplexing must be integrated into the quantum key distribution systems. However, a rapid increase in the quantum bit error rate occurs owing to the presence of undesirable channel noise in fiber-optic communication lines, which eventually results in the impossibility of performing a successful quantum key distribution session. Therefore, accurate and profound analysis of the contributions of channel noise types is required to minimize this noise via the selection of an optimal configuration of classical and quantum channels on the frequency grid.

Compared with single excitons? biexcitons are achieved under a high excitation intensity. The physical model of the biexciton can be simplified as two electrons at the bottom of the conduction band and two holes at the top of the valence band. The luminescence process of biexcitons involves the cascade recombination of two excitons? and the intensity of the biexcitons shows a quadratic scale as a function of the excitation intensity.Biexcitons were first observed in CuCl by Mysyrowicz et al. in 1968 and then extended to other semiconductor materials? including II-VI (ZnSe and CdS? and III-V (GaAs?. In the 1980s? the study of biexcitons spread to low-dimensional semiconductors? such as quantum wells or quantum dots (QDs?? resulting in the discovery of entangled photon pairs as well as predicted advances as a laser gain medium. In the last 40 years? QDs have been widely studied owing to their size-dependent optical properties and potential applications in photonics and optoelectronics. Owing to their well-known quantum confinement effects? QDs offer strong light absorption and a discrete electronic state structure. Therefore? biexcitons in QDs have unique features? including the large binding energy? correlated polarization of the emitted photons? low threshold?and enhanced temperature stability in lasing. These properties provide the advantages of realizing an on-demand entangled photon source and laser diodes.Progress The entangled photons can be generated by biexciton-exciton cascade emission or Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM? interference from indistinguishable photons in QDs (Fig.5?. The degenerate exciton state is a superposition state and emits an exciton photon with opposite circular polarization with respect to the polarization of previously emitted biexciton photons. In 2006? Stevenson et al.demonstrated entangled photon pairs from a single InAs QD. Subsequently? InAs QDs were optimized to achieve high-quality entangled photons with reduced exciton polarization splitting. In 2019? Pan et al. performed a Boson sampling experiment using 20 pure single photons generated by a single InAs/GaAs QD. These results are significant breakthroughs in the field of quantum information and have inspired increased efforts to explore QD-based quantum light sources.In addition to the progress in self-assembled QDs? colloidal QDs have also received considerable attention because of their solution processability and easier spectral tunability. Because of the atom-like discrete structure of the electronic states in QDs? the population inversion is realized only when a fraction of QDs is excited with biexcitons (Fig.7?. The presence of biexcitons leads to an intrinsic nonradiative Auger recombination (Fig.6?.

Sargent etal. used the long Auger lifetime of thick-shell CdSe/CdS QDs to realize continuous wave (CW? lasing. The observed thresholds were 6.4-8.4kW/cm2.

Compared with conventional electronic devices, integrated subwavelength optical devices with high data transmission rates and wide bandwidths provide a promising platform for the development of nanophotonics. In recent decades, various plasmon-based optical elements have been developed, including waveguides, resonators, nanoantennas,multiplexers, and switchers. Polarization-controllable optical elements are important in chip-to-chip interconnects, sensors, and quantum cryptography. Chemically synthesized nanowires have been reported to function as polarization-controllable plasmonic waveguides, where the emission of different SPPs modes relies on the shape of the wire end. Additionally, optical properties sensitive to incident polarization have been observed in coupled nanostructures composed of wires or nanoparticles. For example, the near-field enhancement and far-field emission polarization of coupled junctions can be modulated via incident polarization, through which polarization-dependent routers, modulators, and logic gates have been achieved. Hence, further optimization of coupled waveguides can provide additional flexibility for controlling light polarization at the nanoscale. In this study, we investigated the correlations between the emission and incident polarization of a nanowire-triangular plate coupled structure. The results indicate that the polarization dependence can be modulated by the wire-triangular plate coupling type. The response of the emission polarization to the incident polarization is verified using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. In theory, by calculating the volume integration of the free current density, the conversion of propagating SPP modes and wire-triangular plate coupled mode can be revealed. The emission mechanism of the coupled structures can be elucidated based on the superposition of different SPP modes.The findings provide a new degree of freedom for manipulating light polarization at the nanoscale, and are beneficial to the development of plasmonic nanophotonics.Methods In this study, we fabricated silver nanowire-triangular plate coupled structures using a typical chemical method. A dilute ethanol suspension comprising nanowires and triangular plates was drop-cast onto an indium tin oxide-coated glass slide, where the coupled structures were self-assembled after drying under ambient conditions. Scanning electron microscopy was used to distinguish the different coupled structures, as shown in Figs.2(a) and 3(a). Subsequently, the samples were immersed promptly in an index-matched oil with n=1.518 to protect the samples against oxidization or sulfuration in air. Next, optical measurements were performed, where He-Ne laser with a wavelength of 633 nm was focused onto the nanowire end through an oil objective. The response of the emission polarization to the incident polarization was obtained by rotating the half-wave plate and polarizer. The experimental data were verified via simulation using the FDTD method, and the emission mechanism was determined by calculating the volume integration of the free current density.Results and Discussion The experimental results show different polarization correlations between the excitation and emission of the nanowire-triangular plate coupled structure. The emission polarization follows the direction of the excitation polarization.
Meanwhile, the emission polarization is maintained at 160 degrees, regardless of the incident polarization. In the simulation, we recorded the local near-field distribution and obtained the corresponding far-field emission using the FDTD method. When the triangular plate-nanowire coupling exhibits a ""line"" connection, the emission polarization increases monotonically with the incident polarization.However, when the coupling type exhibits a ""point"" connection, the emission polarization remains at 160 degrees, regardless of the incident light. These experimental and simulation results show that the emission behaviors can be effectively modulated by the wire-triangular plate coupling type. To elucidate the modulation mechanism, we analyzed the plasmon modes excited in the nanowire-triangular plate junction. The three modes contribute to the emission from the junction: hybridized wire modes m=0 and m= 1 and the nanowire-triangular plate coupling mode P(Fig.5). Based on antenna radiation theory and the volume integration of the free current density,we calculate the emission contributed by the triangular plate and nanowire. The results show that the light emitted from the triangular plate is always polarized at 160 degrees, regardless of the incident polarization. It can be understood by the fact that the orientation of induced dipole oscillation is 160 degrees. In addition, the emission polarization from the wire part is the same as the incident polarization. Hence,when the triangular plate-nanowire exhibits ""wire"" coupling, the junction serves as a Fabry-Perot cavity and the wire modes dominate the emission polarization rotating with the incident polarization. When the triangular plate-nanowire exhibits a ""point"" connection, the near-field is mainly localized on the triangular plate, in which the emitted light dominated by coupling mode P with polarization remains in the 160 degrees orientation.Conclusions We fabricated silver nanowire-triangular plate coupled structures via wet chemical synthesis and investigated their polarization correlations between incident light and emission. The results showed that the incidence-emission polarization correlation depended on the coupling type of the nanowire-triangular plate. When the triangular plate-nanowire exhibited a ""line"" connection, a Fabry-Perot cavity was formed in the junction. The polarization of the emitted light followed with the excitation polarization.However, for the ""point"" coupling type, the emission polarization remained at 160 degrees, regardless of the incident polarization. The emission mechanism can be interpreted by the superposition of propagating SPP modes and the localized mode of the coupled nanowire-triangular plate structure. Hence, the emission polarization at the junction can be manipulated by the nanowire-triangular plate coupling type. These findings can be used to develop more sophisticated polarization-controllable devices and are beneficial to the development of integrated nanophotonics",2023,10.3788/CJL221291,CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG,Polarization Dependence Between Excitation and Emission in Nanowire-Triangular Plate Coupled Structures br,Peoples R China,AC,Capital Normal Univ,Capital Normal University,Capital Normal University,"Yuanyuan, Li",JUK-8660-2023,1,seq1_unique,882,True
WOS:000907037200002,Article,"quantum optics,magnon,cavity optomechanical system,coherent optical transmission","INDUCED TRANSPARENCY,MAGNON,MICROWAVE,WAVES",Physical Sciences,Optics,Optics,Science & Technology,"Objective As an interdisciplinary subject of nanophysics and quantum optics, the physical properties of cavity optomechanics have attracted the attention of many researchers. At the same time, with the development of optomechanical systems, cavity magnetic quantum dynamics systems have become a new platform for realizing quantum coherence and coupling between magnons, cavity photons, and mechanical oscillators. This paper proposes the simultaneous input of the control field and detection on both sides. The cavity field (one of the microcavities has a mechanical vibration mode, there is mutual coupling between the optical fields of the two resonators, and the coupling strength is related to the distance between the two resonators) and the dual -resonator magnetomechanical system are composed of magnons. On this basis, the input-output theory is used to analyze the dual -resonator magnetomechanical system under different parameter mechanisms. In the cavity output, magnons, microwave photons, and acoustics can be observed in the presence of cavity -to -cavity coupling. Various coherent properties arise from the coupling between magnons, cavity photons, and mechanical oscillators. These results are new phenomena that have not been revealed in typical electromagnetically induced transparent systems and may be applied to novel optical information-processing devices. Methods In this letter, we begin with a dual -cavity magneto -optical mechanical system model. We analyze the composition of the cavity and provide the definition of each parameter. The magnon directly driven by the microwave source in the cavity a can directly establish a coupling mechanism with the microwave cavity photons. A YIG ball is placed in the maximum magnetic field of the microwave resonant cavity a. In order to bias the YIG ball, a uniform external bias magnetic field needs to be applied along the z direction. The cavity mode driving magnetic field in the y direction is mainly used to deform the YIG ball. The purpose of the dynamic magnetization of the magnon is to ensure that the cavity mode driving magnetic field in the y direction and the uniform external bias magnetic field along the z direction are perpendicular to the magnetic field of the cavity mode in the x direction at the same time. The Heisenberg equation of motion, factorization, and other methods are used to solve the obtained Hamiltonian, and the relational expression between the resonator field and the output field is established. Finally, we explore the different effects under different parameters. We investigate the coherent optical response under different parameter mechanisms, such as the coupling strength (J) between the resonators and the ratio (n) of the probing light intensity of the two resonators, in the case of system interaction, and the optical response transmission characteristics of the optomechanical system can be observed.Results and Discussions This study shows that different properties can be observed in the cavity of a magnetomechanical system under different parameter mechanisms. In the case where the mechanical oscillator is coupled with the magnon and the probe light on the right is turned off (n = 0), when the coupling strength J < Kappa, the greater the coupling strength J of the system, the more obvious the degree of transmission of the system. When the value of the coupling strength J increases to J = Kappa, the optomechanical system exhibits complete transmission at the central resonance, and when J > Kappa, the system exhibits mode splitting (Fig. 2).
In the case where the microwave photons are coupled with the magnons and the probe light on the right is turned off (n = 0), with an increase in the coupling strength J between the two resonators, the peak values of the transparent peaks on both sides gradually increase, while the central resonance strength gradually decreases. When the intensities of the left and right probe light are the same (n = 1), the peak transmittance and reflectance of the left cavity increase with the increase of J. This is because of the quantum coherence between the left and right probe fields (Fig. 3). In the case where microwave photons, mechanical oscillators, and magnons are coupled together and the right probe light is turned off (n = 0), when the coupling strength J between the two resonators is enhanced, the peak values of the transparent peaks on both sides gradually become larger, the peak value at the central resonance gradually becomes smaller, and the standard mode splitting phenomenon occurs. When the effective optomechanical coupling ratio is changed, the width of the transparent peak at the central resonance increases with an increase in the G value; the spacing between the transparent peaks on both sides also increases. Coupling with magnons also allows a portion of the energy to be stored in the magnons (Fig. 4). When the intensity of the probe light on the left and right sides of the system is the same (n = 1), the transmission first increases and then decreases, and the reflection first decreases and then increases on both sides of the optical system. This phenomenon is very important (Fig. 5). Based on this phenomenon, the dynamic control of the dynamic propagation process of weak light signals can be realized, which can be used to construct photonic devices with special functions.Conclusions In this paper, based on an optomechanical system, a dual -resonator magneto-optomechanical system based on magnons is proposed. The numerical results achieved can be displayed analytically under the coupling of the magnon and mechanical oscillator, the coupling of the magnon and microwave photon, and the co -coupling of the three. The detection field is regulated by adjusting the system parameters. This dual -cavity magnetomechanical system can exhibit different optical transmission characteristics, such as mode splitting, perfect quantum expansion coherence, perfect quantum destructive coherence, and absorption of magnon energy, which are very important in the process of quantum information processing. Studying and manipulating these dynamic controls can help us understand phenomena related to cavity opto-mechanical systems from a new perspective.

Quantum gravity Continuity equations are expected to resolve the singularities of classical general relativity for these transformations that have been already explored on an array of recent fundamental observations developed through gravitational amplification of primeval density fluctuations generated in the exceedingly early phase of cosmic evolution. Based on destructive interference of singular spacetime-configurations, I show that higher-order vertical-equilibrium states in curvature terms direct me to resolve black-hole singularities for a vanishing current entanglement in a chemical space both in the spherically symmetric and axisymmetric case. Dynamical mechanisms for singularity-resolution and orbital superpositions are considered observer-dependent features in these quantum reference frames including Galilean transformation, and near-horizon symmetries ranging from supergravity theories to Lorentzian cryptographic signatures to enhance the RoccuffirnaTM's gravity to trap the SARS-COV-2 viruses in practice.

It is also found that the wave functions for bound states can be expressed in terms of the Jacoby polynomial involving either the nonclassical or resultant entropy/information concepts the so called horizontal-equilibrium state, that represents the phase-transformed quantum state of a molecule, corresponding to the optimum, density-dependent ""thermodynamic"" phase in the near-horizon limit, with either SL(2, R) or Poincare iso(1, 1) symmetry as extended to the entire near-horizon geometry. In this paper, I propose an implementation of the algorithm for the Quantum Inspired blAckhole ProductS of TaylOr Fast FourIer transforMatIons (QubAPSOFFiMi) as a quantum circuit consisting of a combination of some Lorentzian signature quantum gates. In my implementation, a data sequence is expressed by a tensor product of vector spaces. Namely, my QFFT is defined as a transformation of the tensor product of stationary radial Schrodinger equations with these potential energy functions of quantum states. It is essentially different from the so-called quantum Fourier transform (QFT) defined to be a horizontal-equilibrium state of linear transformation of the amplitudes for the superposition of quantum states. The quantum circuit for the (QubAPSOFFiMi) consists of several circuits for elementary arithmetic operations such as a quantum adder, subtractor and shift operations, which are implemented as effectively as possible. These analytical expressions for purely vibrational energy levels of the electronic state, without an accompanying change of quantum observables, preserves the electron probability distribution and modifies its current by varying the moduli to a weakly-coupled description of a pharmacophoric system, where states with fixed conserved charge charges can be electronically counted.

Apart from being able to compute the evolution through a known optical system, it is interesting to consider the less studied inverse problem of design: finding the optical system which gives or approximates a desired evolution. Linear optical systems are limited and can only provide a small subset of all the physically possible quantum transformations on multiple photons. Choosing the best approximation for the evolutions that cannot be achieved with linear optics is not trivial. This software deals with the analysis of the quantum evolution of multiple photons in linear optical devices and the design of optical setups that achieve or approximate a desired quantum evolution. Solution method: We have automated multiple computation processes regarding quantum experiments via linear optic devices. The methods rely on the properties of the groups and algebras that describe the problem of light evolution in linear system. The library QOptCraft for Python 3 includes known numerical methods for decomposing an optical system into beam splitters and phase shifters and methods to give the quantum evolution of system classically described by a scattering matrix using either the Heisenberg picture evolution of the states, a description based on the permanents of certain matrices or the evolution from the effective Hamiltonian of the system.
It also provides methods for the design of achievable evolutions, using the adjoint representation, and for approximating quantum evolutions outside the reach of linear optics with an iterative method using Toponogov's comparison theorem from differential geometry. The package is completed with useful functions that deal with systems including losses and gain, described with quasiunitary matrices, the generation of random matrices and stable implementations of the matrix logarithm.Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: The package is designed to work with intermediate scale optical systems. Due to the combinatorial growth in the state space with the number of photons and modes involved, there is an upper limit on the efficiency of any classical calculation.

The research has two main goals. First, providing a complete and organic analysis of the DARQ technologies framework currently missing in the literature. Because this research focuses on the financial sector, more attention is dedicated to DARQ technologies in this industry. Second, studying applications of one of the DARQ technologies, AI, in personalized banking, where it appears to have a great potential impact. Design/methodology/approach The research analyses both the supply side, collecting secondary data from documentation, reports and research studies to study the major trends and results obtained by leading banks, and on the demand side, collecting primary data through a dedicated survey and elaborating opinions and preferences of potential customers. Using this information, a detailed go-to-market plan based on the framework elaborated by Bain and Co. in 2012 is developed, considering the hypothesis of a well-known universal bank, operating globally, with an established brand and access to modern AI technologies, which decides to invest in this field as a priority. Findings In addition to giving a detailed overview of DARQ technologies from a technical and a business perspective, the results related to the hypothetical case of the study help to understand which would be the most suitable target for the launch phase, which value proposition should be offered and how to deliver it, but also how to evolve the project to attract more customers and strengthen the relationship with the existing ones. Nevertheless, this research could be a starting point for future studies and updates, considering related evolutions, investigating more representative demand samples or analyzing how the combination of more DARQ technologies could be applied to the financial sector. Research limitations/implications Some limitations affect this work. First, the topics studied are evolving rapidly and partially dependent on other innovations under development; therefore, they may become obsolete and less significant in the next years. As regard the data collection, the supply-side analysis involves strategical information kept private by companies; therefore, the collected data probably miss some useful details. As concerns primary data, the sample could have been larger and more heterogeneous and biases and misinterpretations could have affected the answers. A compromise has been found between the time and resources available and the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the sample. Practical implications This research could be a tool for financial companies interested in investing in AI for personalized banking, but it also provides useful insights about the whole DARQ framework, which could be interesting for all the financial and nonfinancial firms. Applying AI effectively and efficiently could offer great benefits, both economic and noneconomic, to financial firms but also to their customers, who could benefit from hyper-tailored services at a reasonable and affordable price, whereas in the past, they were reserved only for very important person clients. This win-win situation could lead the way to further investments and consequent innovations in the future.
Social implications Some issues still exist, mainly about data security and privacy, but also the social risk linked to the labor market due to the AI substitution for some tasks and the related shift in professionals required by employers, which could negatively affect the salary gap among workers with different levels of educations, tightening up existing inequality problems. An effort by public and private subjects will be required to make this transition inside the labor market smoother. Despite this, the research shows that AI applications in personalized m-banking could mutually benefit both the demand and the supply of the market. Originality/value Apart from the organic overview offered on DARQ technologies and their related business applications, currently missing in the literature, which could be useful for a better comprehension of the topic and could also give interesting insights to firms, this research presents an original and concrete roadmap to follow for financial companies interested in delivering a personalized mobile banking service leveraging on AI.

Also, some biological lines may be formed between two cells. These biological lines could play the role of wires which transmit information from a place to another one. For example, some signatures of this quantum information teleportation could be seen in biological lines which are emerged near the plant cell walls or gates or close to chloroplasts. Chloroplasts shoot some spinors which maybe confined within the micro-bubbles or absorb by microbes. These bubbles and microbes may join to each other and form some biological lines which may be strengthen from a plant cell to another. These biological lines could be seen near the plant cell walls or on a metal which connects two parts of a leaf. 2. Some another signatures of ""quantum photon exchange or quantum information teleportation"" could be seen between microbes under the objective lenses and macro-objects on the eye lenses of a light microscope. It seems that as microscope make big images from microbes for us, produce small pictures of macro-objects for microbes such as they could diagnose them and interact with them. This property could be used in controlling microbes. 3. Another way for controlling microbes is using of virtual shapes which are induced by a special light source. For example, using a multi-gonal lamp, one can induce multi-gonal shape within the micro-bubbles. Also, this special lamp could force microbes and micro-bubbles to build multi-gonal colonies on a metal-glass slide. Maybe, by using this property, one can build a light source with the shape of anti-microbial matter and induce anti-microbial property within micro-bubbles. 4. Another main way for quantum teleportation is using of gravitational holes which may be emerged by increasing concentration of microbes and heavy cells in some points. These holes absorb microbes and micro-bubbles and conduct them to the heavy cells. Usually, there are some white holes near these dark holes which as a proposal, one can assume that these white holes are another end of gravitational holes and emit photons which are entered from dark end. 5. And finally, a very main mechanism for quantum information teleportation with microbes and controlling them is using of a holography and inducing virtual microbes and biological molecules in biological systems. For example, by a combinations of two lights with different colors under a light microscope in a dark room, one may induce some non-virtual microbes in biological systems such as each microbe interacts with a virtual microbe. This is because that light waves take photos of microbes, collide with lenses of microscopes and return to the slide and form virtual microbes or biological molecules. This technique could be used in curing diseases.
Although, results of our experiments show the correctness of these mechanisms and theories, however, for the moment, we propose them only as a proposal and hypothesis and hope that other scientists do similar experiments. Also, some of our experiments may be at preliminary stages; however they could be used as a hypothesis, proposal and guidance.
